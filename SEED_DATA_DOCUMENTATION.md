## 🚀 **Installation & Usage**

### **Method 1: TypeScript Seeder (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --save-dev tsx

# Run the comprehensive seeder
npm run seed:demo-data
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Creates Supabase Auth users with passwords
- ✅ Handles profile creation automatically
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Progress reporting during seeding
- ✅ Safe for multiple runs (clears existing data)

### **Method 2: Direct SQL Seeder**
```bash
# Run SQL seed file directly
npm run seed:sql
```

**Note**: SQL method requires manual user creation in Supabase Auth dashboard.

### **Method 3: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Copy content from `supabase/seed.sql`
2. Run in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Manually create auth users with emails matching profiles
