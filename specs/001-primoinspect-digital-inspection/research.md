**Updated**: Enhanced with Session 2025-01-27 clarifications for conflict resolution and real-time workflows

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for implementing PrimoInspect's mobile-first inspection platform with **enhanced operational workflow clarity**, including manager-mediated conflict resolution, delayed-approval escalation, project-completion boundary role changes, status-first offline sync, and instant real-time update broadcasting.

## Next.js 14 App Router for Mobile-First Architecture

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with React Server Components for role-based layouts
**Rationale**:

- App Router provides excellent mobile performance through automatic code splitting
- Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript for faster mobile loading
- Route groups enable clean role-based dashboard organization
- Built-in support for responsive layouts and mobile-first design

**Alternatives considered**:

- Pages Router (legacy, less mobile-optimized)
- Remix (good mobile performance but smaller ecosystem)
- Vite + React Router (requires more configuration for mobile optimization)

**Implementation Pattern**:

```
app/
├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── executive/page.tsx     # Executive dashboard
│   ├── manager/page.tsx       # Project manager dashboard
│   └── inspector/page.tsx     # Inspector follow-up dashboard
├── layout.tsx                 # Root layout with mobile navigation
└── globals.css                # Tailwind mobile-first styles
```

**Real-Time Patterns**:

- Use polling (5-second intervals) for inspection status updates
- Implement optimistic updates for evidence uploads
- Cache evidence metadata to reduce mobile data usage
- Background sync for offline mobile submissions

## File Upload Architecture for 50MB Evidence Files

**Decision**: Direct upload to cloud storage with progress tracking and mobile optimization
**Rationale**:

- Large file support (50MB photos/videos) requires efficient streaming
- Mobile networks need chunked uploads with resume capability
- Progress feedback essential for mobile user experience
- Automatic compression for mobile uploads

**Alternatives considered**:

- Base64 encoding (inefficient for large files)
- Server-side processing (increases latency)
- Client-side only (no backup/recovery)

**Mobile Upload Strategy**:

- Implement chunked uploads with resumable capability
- Show upload progress with shadcn/ui Progress component
- Automatic image compression for mobile photos
- Offline queue for evidence captured without connectivity

## MapLibre GL for Evidence Location Verification

**Decision**: MapLibre GL JS for client-side mapping with mobile touch optimization
**Rationale**:

- Lightweight mapping solution for mobile performance
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile evidence placement
- Offline map caching for field work
- No licensing costs unlike Google Maps

**Alternatives considered**:

- Google Maps (licensing costs, privacy concerns)
- Leaflet (less mobile-optimized)
- Mapbox GL (similar but commercial)

**Mobile Mapping Patterns**:

- Touch-friendly zoom/pan controls
- Large tap targets for location markers
- Simplified UI for mobile evidence placement
- Offline map tiles for remote project sites

## Authentication with NextAuth Mobile Optimization

**Decision**: NextAuth v5 with email/password provider and mobile-optimized flows
**Rationale**:

- Simple authentication matching clarified requirements
- Mobile-friendly authentication flows
- Built-in CSRF protection and secure session management
- Easy integration with Next.js App Router

**Mobile Auth Strategy**:

- Large, touch-friendly login forms
- Remember me functionality for mobile convenience
- Automatic session extension for field workers
- Mobile-optimized password reset flows

## Form Management with React Hook Form + Zod

**Decision**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for mobile-optimized forms
**Rationale**:

- Excellent mobile performance with minimal re-renders
- TypeScript integration with Zod schemas

## Enhanced Operational Workflows (Session 2025-01-27)

### Manager-Mediated Conflict Resolution

**Decision**: Implement side-by-side evidence comparison interface for project managers
**Rationale**:
- Maintains evidence-driven decision making constitutional principle
- Preserves approval hierarchy without automation complexity
- Enables clear audit trail for disputed inspections
- Mobile-accessible resolution interface for field managers

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// Conflict detection triggers manager notification
const conflictResolution = {
  detection: 'Automatic flagging of simultaneous evidence submissions',
  notification: 'Real-time alert to project manager with conflict details',
  interface: 'Side-by-side comparison view with approval controls',
  resolution: 'Manager decision becomes authoritative with audit trail'
}
```

### Status-First Offline Synchronization

**Decision**: Prioritize status changes and critical updates before evidence file uploads
**Rationale**:
- Enables immediate workflow coordination when connectivity restored
- Project managers receive critical updates without waiting for file transfers
- Maintains real-time collaboration during intermittent connectivity
- Background evidence uploads don't block status communication

**Sync Priority Queue**:
1. **Immediate**: Status changes, approval decisions, escalation flags
2. **High Priority**: Inspection metadata, location data, timestamps
3. **Background**: Evidence files, thumbnails, supplementary media

### Instant Real-time Update Broadcasting

**Decision**: Every change broadcasts immediately to all connected users
**Rationale**:
- Maximum responsiveness for time-sensitive field operations
- Immediate conflict detection and resolution triggering
- Enhanced collaborative decision-making for distributed teams
- Constitutional alignment with mobile-first real-time principles

**Broadcasting Strategy**:
```typescript
const realtimeStrategy = {
  frequency: 'Instant (no throttling or batching)',
  scope: 'All connected users with appropriate permissions',
  channels: 'Project-level, inspection-level, user-level subscriptions',
  fallback: 'Offline queue with immediate sync on reconnection'
}
```
