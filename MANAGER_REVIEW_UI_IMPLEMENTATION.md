# Manager Inspection Review UI Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the manager inspection review and approval UI that was missing from the application.

## Problem Statement
When inspectors filled out and submitted an inspection, its status changed to `IN_REVIEW`, but there was no UI for managers to review and approve/reject the inspection. The approval API endpoint and form component existed, but weren't accessible through any page.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Review Page (`app/inspections/[id]/review/page.tsx`)

A comprehensive inspection review page that allows project managers to:

- **View full inspection details** including:
  - Inspector information
  - Submission date
  - Priority level
  - Associated project and checklist

- **Review all inspection responses**:
  - Question-by-question breakdown
  - Visual badges for pass/fail and yes/no responses
  - Inspector notes for each question
  - Evidence attachment indicators

- **View evidence gallery**:
  - All uploaded photos/files
  - Verification status
  - Location data (if available)
  - Timestamps
  - Click to open full-size

- **Approve or reject inspections** using the existing `ApprovalForm` component:
  - Approve with notes
  - Reject with detailed feedback
  - Escalation workflow support for repeated rejections
  - Real-time escalation status tracking

### 2. Updated Manager Dashboard (`app/dashboard/manager/page.tsx`)

Enhanced the "Pending Approvals" section to:

- Display more detailed information for each pending inspection:
  - Project name
  - Inspector name
  - Submission date
  - Priority badge

- Added direct "Review" buttons that navigate to the review page
- Better visual hierarchy with card-based layout
- Improved accessibility with proper hover states

## Technical Details

### Routes
- **Review Page**: `/inspections/[id]/review`
  - Protected route (requires PROJECT_MANAGER or EXECUTIVE role)
  - Fetches full inspection data including responses, evidence, and checklist
  - Integrates with existing approval API

### API Integration
The review page uses existing APIs:
- `GET /api/inspections/[id]` - Fetch inspection details
- `POST /api/inspections/[id]/approve` - Submit approval decision

### Data Flow
1. Inspector completes inspection → status changes to `IN_REVIEW`
2. Manager sees notification on dashboard
3. Manager clicks "Review" button → navigates to review page
4. Manager reviews all responses and evidence
5. Manager approves or rejects with notes
6. Status changes to `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`
7. Inspector receives notification of decision

### Status Workflow
```
DRAFT → PENDING → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED/REJECTED
         ↑_______________|
         (if rejected)
```

## Key Features

### Access Control
- Only users with `PROJECT_MANAGER` or `EXECUTIVE` roles can access the review page
- Non-authorized users see an access restriction message

### Validation
- Warns if inspection status is not `IN_REVIEW`
- Displays rejection count warnings
- Shows escalation status for repeated rejections

### Real-time Updates
- Integrates with existing real-time notification system
- Shows escalation alerts
- Updates dashboard automatically

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Sticky approval form on desktop
- Optimized for both small and large screens

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `app/inspections/[id]/review/page.tsx` (new file)
   - Complete review interface for managers

2. **Modified**: `app/dashboard/manager/page.tsx`
   - Enhanced pending approvals section with review buttons

## Testing Recommendations

To test the complete workflow:

1. **As Inspector**:
   - Create or access an inspection in DRAFT status
   - Fill out the checklist
   - Upload evidence
   - Submit for review (changes status to IN_REVIEW)

2. **As Manager**:
   - Check dashboard for pending approvals
   - Click "Review" button on an inspection
   - Review all responses and evidence
   - Approve or reject with notes
   - Verify notification is sent to inspector

3. **Edge Cases to Test**:
   - Non-manager trying to access review page (should see restriction)
   - Reviewing an inspection not in IN_REVIEW status
   - Rejecting an inspection that's already been rejected (escalation)
   - Viewing evidence with/without location data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the review UI:

1. **Inline Evidence Viewing**: Modal or lightbox for evidence images
2. **Comparison View**: Compare current submission with previous rejected versions
3. **Bulk Actions**: Approve/reject multiple inspections at once
4. **Custom Checklists**: Different review criteria based on inspection type
5. **Comments/Discussion**: Thread-based comments between inspector and manager
6. **Review History**: View all previous approval decisions and notes
7. **Filtering**: Filter pending reviews by priority, project, or inspector

## Dependencies

The implementation relies on existing components and utilities:
- `ApprovalForm` component (already existed)
- Supabase auth hooks
- UI components (Card, Badge, Button)
- Toast notifications
- Real-time notification system

## Notes

- The approval API already had proper escalation logic for repeated rejections
- The `ApprovalForm` component already supported escalation warnings
- No database migrations were needed - all required fields existed
- The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase
