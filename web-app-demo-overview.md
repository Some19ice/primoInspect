# PrimoInspect Web App Demo Overview (Non‑Technical)

## Introduction

PrimoInspect is a digital inspection and reporting platform tailored for renewable energy projects. The web app gives leaders and managers real‑time visibility into field work, while making it easy to assign inspections, review evidence, approve results, and share reports with stakeholders. Inspectors primarily capture data on mobile, and the web app is where teams coordinate, monitor progress, and close the loop on quality and compliance.

This demo focuses on what users see and do in the web experience—how they plan, track, review, and communicate outcomes—without any technical implementation details.

## Purpose

## Personas

- **Executive**: Needs instant visibility into KPIs, risks, and outcomes across projects.
- **Project Manager**: Orchestrates work—assigns inspections, monitors progress, resolves issues, and approves results.
- **Inspector (Web context)**: Reviews assigned tasks, uploads supporting evidence, and responds to manager feedback; primary data capture occurs on mobile.

## Data & Content Assumptions for the Demo

- Preloaded sample projects, templates, users, and a few recent inspections.
- A handful of realistic media files (photos, short videos) attached to inspections.
- At least one inspection in each key status to demonstrate end‑to‑end flow.

## Out of Scope for This Demo

- Deep technical configuration, system integrations, and backend administration.
- Mobile capture specifics (covered in the mobile demo; referenced here only as context).

## Success Criteria

- Stakeholders can answer: “What’s happening now? What needs attention? What changed?”
- Managers can assign work, review submissions, approve/reject, and communicate next steps.
- Executives can view KPIs, generate reports, and understand project health at a glance.
- The flow feels fast, clear, and confidence‑inspiring without technical explanations.

## Stretch Enhancements (If Time Permits)

- Annotated media overlay in the inspection review.
- Simple risk heatmap by asset type or location.
- Saved dashboard views per persona.
