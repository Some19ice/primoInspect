# Inspection Execution Page - Fixes & Enhancements

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Hydration Error - HTML Nesting Issue**
**Problem**: `<div>` elements were nested inside `<p>` tags in the EvidenceUpload component, causing React hydration errors.

**Location**: `components/evidence/evidence-upload.tsx` line 233-238

**Fix**: Replaced `CardDescription` wrapper with conditional rendering:
- When `questionText` exists: Use plain `<div>` with appropriate styling
- When no `questionText`: Use `CardDescription` component properly

**Result**: ‚úÖ No more hydration errors, proper HTML structure
