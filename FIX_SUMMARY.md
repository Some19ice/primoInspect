# Quick Fix Summary - Inspection Submission Error

## Problem
Inspectors couldn't save or submit inspection responses due to database constraint violation.

## Root Cause
Seed data used invalid status `'ASSIGNED'` which isn't in the database CHECK constraint:
- **Allowed:** DRAFT, PENDING, IN_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED
- **Used in seed:** ASSIGNED ❌

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Files
- ✅ `supabase/seed.sql` - Changed ASSIGNED → DRAFT
- ✅ `app/inspections/[id]/execute/page.tsx` - Better error handling
- ✅ `app/api/inspections/[id]/route.ts` - Detailed logging

### 2. Created Files
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20250106_fix_assigned_status.sql` - Migration to fix existing data
- ✅ `INSPECTION_SUBMISSION_ERROR_FIX.md` - Full documentation

## How to Apply

Run this SQL in Supabase:
```sql
UPDATE inspections 
SET status = 'DRAFT'
WHERE status = 'ASSIGNED';
```

Then restart dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Test
