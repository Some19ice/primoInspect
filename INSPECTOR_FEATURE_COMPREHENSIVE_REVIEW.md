## 2. Code-Level Issues & Bugs

### 2.1 Critical Bugs

#### BUG #1: Inspection Detail Page Missing Core Functionality
**File:** `app/inspections/[id]/page.tsx`
**Lines:** 296-300

```typescript
// Current: Button does nothing
{inspection.status.toLowerCase() === 'draft' && (
  <Button>
    Start Inspection  // ❌ No onClick handler
  </Button>
)}
```

**Fix Needed:**
```typescript
<Button onClick={() => router.push(`/inspections/${inspection.id}/execute`)}>
  Start Inspection
</Button>
```

---

#### BUG #2: Mobile Interface Camera Not Working
**File:** `components/inspector/mobile-inspection-interface.tsx`
**Lines:** 43-79

**Problems:**
1. `videoRef` never becomes visible
2. No UI to show camera preview
3. `takePhoto()` never called - no button
4. Blob conversion but no upload to Evidence API

**Fix Needed:**
- Add camera preview UI
- Add capture button
- Integrate with `/api/evidence/upload`
- Link to current question

---

#### BUG #3: Evidence Upload Doesn't Link to Questions
**File:** `components/evidence/evidence-upload.tsx`
**Lines:** 32-43

**Problem:**
```typescript
interface EvidenceUploadProps {
  inspectionId: string
  questionId?: string  // ✅ Exists
  // But linkage not implemented in upload
}
```

**Impact:** Evidence uploaded but not associated with specific checklist questions

---

#### BUG #4: No Response Validation Before Submission
**Problem:** Inspector can "complete" inspection without answering required questions

**Missing:**
- Validation function to check required fields
- UI indication of incomplete questions
- Prevention of submission if incomplete

---

#### BUG #5: Inspection Form Priority Case Mismatch
**File:** `components/forms/inspection-form.tsx`
**Lines:** 127-135

```typescript
// Form sends lowercase
<option value="low">Low</option>
<option value="medium">Medium</option>
<option value="high">High</option>

// But API expects uppercase
priority: priority as 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH'
```

**Impact:** Type mismatch, potential runtime errors

---

### 2.2 High Priority Bugs

#### BUG #6: Duplicate Inspector Loading Logic
**File:** `components/forms/enhanced-inspection-form.tsx`
**Lines:** 82-139 and 142-180

**Problem:** Two separate useEffect hooks loading inspectors - inefficient and can cause race conditions

---

#### BUG #7: No Error Boundary Around Inspection Execution
**Problem:** If inspection data fails to load, app crashes instead of graceful error

---

#### BUG #8: Real-time Updates Not Implemented for Inspection Status
**Problem:** Hook exists (`use-realtime-inspections.ts`) but status change subscriptions not set up for individual inspections

---

#### BUG #9: GPS Location Capture But No Usage
**File:** `components/inspector/mobile-inspection-interface.tsx`
**Lines:** 24-37

**Problem:**
- Location captured on mount
- Stored in state
- But never sent to backend
- Not attached to inspection submission

---

#### BUG #10: Voice Recording Incomplete
**File:** `components/inspector/mobile-inspection-interface.tsx`
**Lines:** 81-89

```typescript
const startVoiceNote = async () => {
  try {
    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
    setIsRecording(true)
    // ❌ TODO: Voice recording implementation would go here
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Feature shown to users but doesn't work

---

### 2.3 Medium Priority Bugs

#### BUG #11: Inspection Progress Not Tracked
**Problem:** No calculation of completion percentage based on answered questions

#### BUG #12: Draft Auto-Save Missing
**Problem:** "Save Draft" button exists but doesn't persist responses

#### BUG #13: Offline Queue Not Implemented
**Problem:** Offline work promised but no queue system exists

#### BUG #14: Evidence Thumbnail Generation Missing
**Problem:** Full images loaded instead of thumbnails

#### BUG #15: No Duplicate Evidence Check
**Problem:** Can upload same file multiple times
